# Simple2DRaycaster

A simple 2D raycasting engine built using SDL2 that simulates a day/night cycle, complete with a dynamic sky and stars. This project demonstrates basic raycasting techniques to render walls and objects, providing an interactive environment where the player can move around and explore.

## Features
- **Raycasting Engine**: A basic 2D raycasting engine that renders walls based on player movement and viewing angle.
- **Day/Night Cycle**: The time of day dynamically changes, with the sky transitioning from light blue during the day to dark blue at night. Stars appear when the night begins.
- **Interactive Player Movement**: The player can move forward, backward, and rotate left or right using the keyboard.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **SDL2**: The project uses the SDL2 library to handle graphics and input. You will need to have SDL2 installed to build and run this project.
  
  - On Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
    ```
  - On macOS (using Homebrew):
    ```bash
    brew install sdl2
    ```
